# ChangeLog for biblio.py
#

v0.56 (sanity), bkarak:
		* FIXED: Minor fixes in bibtex parser

v0.55 (sanity), bkarak:
		* FIXED: ~/.biblio.py/repositories file is now created correctly, when you run the program for the first time
		* ADDED: pdf storage support
		
		Now biblio.py automatically find and adds to each bibtex entry pdf file that contain the actual document.
		The pdf file is stored in a folder with the bib file's name, in the same directory. For example, the file '/home/bkarak/foo.bib'
		should contain the pdf files in '/home/bkarak/foo'. The pdf file should have as filename the entry's key.
		
		The entry that will be generated will look like:
		
		@techreport{GRSH00,
			Title = {Rules of Thumb in Data Engineering},
			Year = {2000},
			Author = {Jim Gray and Prashant Shenoy},
